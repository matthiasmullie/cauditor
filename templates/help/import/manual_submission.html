<h1>Submit your own metrics</h1>

<p>
    History of all linked repositories will be analyzed, and so will new commits as they are pushed.<br/>
    However, you may wish to analyze a repo yourself, if you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Want to analyze a private repository</li>
    <li>Don't want to login with GitHub & link your project</li>
    <li>Don't want to wait until Cauditor's import queue gets around to analyzing your project</li>
    <li>Are a nice person and want to take some of the import duties away from Cauditor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Continuous integration</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Add a dependency on cauditor/analyzer to your <strong>composer.json</strong> file if you use <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> to manage the dependencies of your project:</p>
<pre>composer require cauditor/analyzer --dev</pre>
<p>This will make the Cauditor analyzer available in your CI server.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Add this to your <strong>.travis.yml</strong>'s <code>after_success</code> statements:</p>
<pre>after_success:
- vendor/bin/cauditor</pre>
<p>It'll instruct <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> to generate the metrics & submit them to cauditor.org. <i>This should also work on other CI providers.</i></p>

<h2>On your own machine</h2>

<p>Similar to how code would be analyzed on Travis CI if you follow the above steps, you can run it on your own machine:</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Add a global dependency on cauditor/analyzer:</p>
<pre>composer global require cauditor/analyzer</pre>
<p>This will make the Cauditor analyzer available for your entire machine, instead of for just 1 project.</p>

<h3>Run</h3>

<p>Now you can play around with the script! You can analyze all commits of a particular project like this:</p>
<pre>cauditor --repo=https://github.com/vendor/repo.git --path=/tmp/import --all</pre>
<p>Execute <code>cauditor --help</code> to find out more.</p>
