<h1>Cyclomatic complexity</h1>

<p>
    Cyclomatic complexity is calculated by counting the <strong>amount of decision paths</strong>.
    After an <code>if</code> statement, your code can go do 2 different things.
    Every conditional statement increases the complexity of your program.
    It's harder to test, likely contains more bugs & is harder to understand when you look at it again.
</p>
<p>
    The cyclomatic complexity is calculated by counting the amount of these conditional statements in the
    code: <code>?</code>, <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
    <code>xor</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>elseif</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>foreach</code>,
    <code>case</code>, <code>while</code> & <code>catch</code>.
</p>
<pre>if ($user-&gt;isLoggedIn()) {
    echo 'Welcome back, ' . $user-&gt;getName();
} else {
    echo 'Hi there, stranger!';
}
</pre>
<p>
    In the above code example, there are 2 possible code paths: either <code>$user</code> is logged in
    (in which case a personalized text is displayed), or isn't (and a generic message is shown).
    It has a cyclomatic complexity of <strong>2</strong>.
</p>
<p>The more decision paths there are, the harder it becomes to reason about the logic &amp; test it.</p>
