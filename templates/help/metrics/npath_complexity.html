<h1>NPath complexity</h1>

<p>
    NPath complexity is very much like <a href="/help/metrics/cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> in that it also calculates
    the amount of paths. Or possible outcomes, rather.
</p>
<pre>if ($user-&gt;getSalutation()) {
    echo $user-&gt;getSalutation().' ';
}

if ($user-&gt;getName()) {
    echo $user-&gt;getName();
} else {
    echo 'anonymous';
}
</pre>
<p>
    The above code example has a cyclomatic complexity of 3 (2 <code>if</code>'s and an <code>else</code>),
    but because of how they're structured, there are 4 possible outcomes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>$salutation $name</li>
    <li>$name</li>
    <li>$salutation anonymous</li>
    <li>anonymous</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The combination of multiple decision paths can compound in multiple different outcomes. Especially when
    nested, the amount of possible outcomes can increase exponentially. Then imagine the amount of tests it
    takes to test every possible outcome.
