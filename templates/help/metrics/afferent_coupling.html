<h1>Afferent Coupling</h1>

<p>
    Afferent coupling measures the responsibility of a class by counting the incoming dependencies,
    or <strong>how often a class is used in other classes</strong>. The higher the value, the more important
    the class is and the bigger its impact on the codebase. Changes to or bugs in these areas can have a big
    impact since they cover a lot of the codebase. These classes should be stable &amp; thoroughly tested.
</p>
<p>
    High afferent coupling is not necessarily a bad thing and will naturally occur for certain pieces of
    code (e.g. core functionality will usually score high).
    It only becomes a problem if those classes change often, or if afferent coupling is unnaturally high
    across the entire application.

<p>
    <strong>The more classes depend on a class, the higher the chance one of them breaks when it changes.</strong>
