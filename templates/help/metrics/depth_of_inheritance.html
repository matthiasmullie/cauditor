<h1>Depth of Inheritance</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Inheritance is good</strong> because you reuse code for objects that are very similar in
    functionality and structure all of them in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
    There can also be too much, however. The deeper you extend a class, the more complex it becomes because
    you have increasingly more parents you depend on. And if one of those change, so do the children, which
    makes these classes less stable.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to that, every class likely adds some of their own methods. The deeper you nest, the more
    methods you inherit from all the ancestors. And more code = a higher likelihood of errors.
</p>
