<h1>Halstead Intelligent Content</h1>

<p>
    Halstead intelligent content represents the algorithm complexity in a mostly language-agnostic way by
    counting the amount of operators (<code>+</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>&&</code>, &hellip; and all
    reserved words like <code>if</code> and <code>for</code>) and operands (values, variables, function
    names, &hellip;)
</p>
<p>
    The exact formula to calculate this metric is quite complex because it tries to be programming language
    independent, and some languages are much more verbose than others:
</p>
<pre>
n1 = amount of unique operators
n2 = amount of unique operand
N1 = total amount of operators
N2 = total amount of operands

N = N1 + N2 = program length
V = N * log2(n1 + n2) = program volume
L = (2 / n1) * (n2 / N2) = program level
D = 1 / L = program difficulty
I = V / D = intelligent content
</pre>
<p>
    The basics are very simple: the more operators and operands, the more complex a program is.<br/>
    The more operators or operands, the bigger the program volume. More unique operators or fewer unique
    operands means higher difficulty. Given 2 different implementations of a same algorithm, the longer one
    will score higher.
</p>
<pre>echo 'How are you';</pre>
<pre>$array = ['how', 'are', 'you'];
$string = implode(' ', $array);
$string = ucfirst($string);
echo $string;
</pre>
<p>
    Both of the above snippets perform the exact same thing, but the second one is a bit more complex:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have to know more about the environment (what do <code>implode</code> &amp; <code>ucfirst</code> do)</li>
  <li>there are more steps to reason about</li>
  <li>there are more places where something could go wrong (e.g. <code>implode</code> argument order could change)</li>
</ul>
